# Color Matcher
This is a color mini-game platform. Its main goal is to provide an entertaining way to learn how RGB and CYMK color behaves.

## Short History
Started out as a personal project for experimenting with CYMK half-tones. Later, it turned into a color-matching game that allowes you to play with the color mixes, looking to equal two colors.
While looking for an academic application, along with Matias Castella we explored the options of having different physical color filters to better experience the color mixing, but ultimately decided against them since it proposed an extra hurdle.

### Where we are now:
Getting ready for academic use, Finalizing details and polishing up the UI and the grading system. 



Works with Harp v0.9.x
